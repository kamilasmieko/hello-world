I have study in the US on the NEIU but in the middle of my study I had to come back to Poland. I have stayed here for 2 years now and I was able to establish a family. I also realize that I would like to move forward with my career and complete my study but also find aa way to get started within the IT world here, in Poland. And for that reason I have decided to start a course at the CodersLab.
